## Log

## R1D1: September 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the UI files for the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for over 2 months, but I just decided to start 100 Days of Code. Today was the first day of build week at Lambda School. Was super glad to not have encountered any issues with merging commits to the Master branch. Today was mostly planning and working on the UI of the app. I enjoyed working on the UI/layout files and adding functionality to it.

## R1D2: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added more functionality to the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** Find it helpful to test the app after each new feature is added to ensure that the app still works properly and that it does exactly what it is supposed to do.

## R1D3: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** App is linked to the backend for the Build Week app: Rvbnb.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool to see the app working with the backend! Also, the internet is amazing to look up things. Learned how to hide text for passwords that are entered and how to show it when a button is clicked. Hoping to incorporate LiveData into the app tomorrow.

## Log

### R1D1: September 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the UI files for the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for over 2 months, but I just decided to start 100 Days of Code. Today was the first day of build week at Lambda School. Was super glad to not have encountered any issues with merging commits to the Master branch. Today was mostly planning and working on the UI of the app. I enjoyed working on the UI/layout files and adding functionality to it.

### R1D2: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added more functionality to the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** Find it helpful to test the app after each new feature is added to ensure that the app still works properly and that it does exactly what it is supposed to do.

## Log

## R1D1: September 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the UI files for the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for over 2 months, but I just decided to start 100 Days of Code. Today was the first day of build week at Lambda School. Was super glad to not have encountered any issues with merging commits to the Master branch. Today was mostly planning and working on the UI of the app. I enjoyed working on the UI/layout files and adding functionality to it.

## R1D2: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added more functionality to the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** Find it helpful to test the app after each new feature is added to ensure that the app still works properly and that it does exactly what it is supposed to do.

## R1D3: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** App is linked to the backend for the Build Week app: Rvbnb.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool to see the app working with the backend! Also, the internet is amazing to look up things. Learned how to hide text for passwords that are entered and how to show it when a button is clicked. Hoping to incorporate LiveData into the app tomorrow.

## R1D4: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** App is finished and meets all of the MVP requirements for Build Week: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** Learned some great things while working on this app. Definitely want to take what I learned to make my own app. It'll help me practice coding more as well.

## R1D5: September 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made final UI adjustments for the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** Even after finishing making UI adjustments, my mind was still thinking about the app and what could be done to improve it. It pretty much kept me up all night. I'm considering making another version of the app so that I could practice coding more.

## R1D6: September 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a new project.

**Thoughts:** Would like to apply the things that I've learned and apply it to a personal project that I'm creating on Android Studio. Hoping this would help solidify what has been taught.

## R1D7: September 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on my personal project.

**Thoughts:** Continuing to code everyday. Hope I can keep this up. Thought it'd be hard to make time over the weekend to code, but it wasn't. Just have to set your mind to do it. Starting to get in the hang of designing the UI for activities. I enjoy doing it as it lets me be creative. There's definitely still more to learn. Would like to experiment and try new features.

## R1D8: September 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Learned debugging tools.

**Thoughts:** Practiced my debugging skills on someone else's app. It's a bit more work to debug someone else's project since not entirely familiar how the app was coded/built. Would help if the developer made some comments throughout their app.

## R1D9: October 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Learned about Stetho & LeakCanary.

**Thoughts:** Did not know about the Developer Tool in Chrome. Also learned how to use the Profiler in Android Studio. Pretty cool tools.

## R1D10: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Learned about Unit Testing.

**Thoughts:** For Unit Testing, we learned how to use Android Studio's tools to add unit tests to a project, write basic unit tests, and run them to ensure that the code works correctly.

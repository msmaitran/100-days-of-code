# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the UI files for the Build Week app: RVbnb.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for over 2 months, but I just decided to start 100 Days of Code. Today was the first day of build week at Lambda School. Was super glad to not have encountered any issues with merging commits to the Master branch. Today was mostly planning and working on the UI of the app. I enjoyed working on the UI/layout files and adding functionality to it.
